Cupertino version of the stock [Material Stepper](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Stepper-class.html)
in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

Stepper is a widget that displays progress through a sequence of steps. Steppers are particularly
useful in the case of forms where one step requires the completion of another one, or where multiple
steps need to be completed in order to submit the whole form.

## Usage

To use this package, add `cupertino_stepper` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).
